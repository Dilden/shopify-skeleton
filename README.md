# Shopify Skeleton Theme
This theme is intended to be a starter theme for building sites on the Shopify platform. It uses Liquid for templating and Tailwind CSS for styling elements.

## Why?
I needed a barebones, minimalist project to get started building on Shopify.

## Requirements
- Shopify CLI
- Node.js
- NPM

## Get Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Install everything with `npm install`
3. Open a terminal and run `npm run watch` to watch for style changes in your CSS
4. Open another terminal and run `npm run start` to start the Shopify CLI (`shopify theme dev`)

## What next?
Simply start putting together your site!
